 Blogpost: appsignal blog <add link>

## In this repo:

* devise.nl.yml: with new, streamlined Dutch translation (In the Checklist: step 3)ðŸ‡³
This translation uses a user centered, informal tone of voice, in a consistent style for all the i18n-ed user interface strings provided by the Devise gem. 

* active_record.nl.yml: the keys for the User attributes (In the Checklist: steps 5 and 7)
Optimized for using in both the Devise forms and the Rails error messages.
